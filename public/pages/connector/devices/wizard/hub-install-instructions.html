Our Hub runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows. It's system requirements are small enough to run on a Raspberry Pi.  Here are the instructions on how to install your Hub:
  </p>
  <p>
1. Verify that Node.JS is installed on your machine.  You can do this by opening a command line window or terminal and typing:
</p>
<pre>
node -v
</pre>
<p>
  If your system returns a version number and it's greater than 8.0 please proceed to step 2; otherwise, goto to <a href="http://nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a> and download/install Node.JS following their instructions - and then proceed to step 2.
</p>
<p>
2. Download and unzip our Hub from <a href="https://github.com/skynetim/gateway/archive/master.zip">GitHub</a>. Goto your new unzipped directory and run the following commands:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
npm install
node server.js
</pre>
</p>
<p>
3. Select 'Next' to start hacking!
